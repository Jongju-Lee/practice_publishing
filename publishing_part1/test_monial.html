              As we all know, it’s easy for marketers to brag about how great
              their product or service is. Writing compelling copy, shooting
              enticing photos, or even producing glamorous videos are all
              tactics we use to draw attention to our brands. While all of these
              strategies can be successful, there really is no better way to
              gain trust and prove the validity of your brand like customer
              testimonials.
